Data representation assignment for OOP 15/16

#The dataset that I will be investigating in this project is all of the executions that formally took place in America from 1608 - 2002.
Only cases that were brought through court are evident in this list. The source of the information is: http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions-us-1608-2002-espy-file.

#Curiosities
There are a few things that I would like to investigate in this file.

•	Represent the data in relation to race to figure out how many whites, blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans were executed.
    That could then lead to finding out what was the most used method on which particular race for example,
    how many white people were hanged overall and compare it to the amount of Hispanics electrocuted.
•	Also we could figure out what was the preferred method of execution of each state by figuring out what was used the most over the course of 398 years.
•	See if there is any correlation between certain crimes and method of execution.

 -> I have a few plans in relation to designing the data representations.
    I will attempt to represent the data in a 3d fashion using relevant objects for each method of execution. For example I could use a lightning bolt to represent electrocutions,
    a noose to represent hangings, needle for injections etc... all the sizes of these objects could be decided by the amount of executed using these methods. 
 
 -> The years in which are presented to the user will be dynamically changeable. They will have a choice to view a particular year and specific details concerning that year.
    There will also be a statistics page which will also be interchangeable by the user.
