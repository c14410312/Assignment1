#Executions in America from 1608-2002
 The source of the information is: http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/executions-us-1608-2002-espy-file.

#Curiosities
There are a few things that I have investigated in this file.

•	A correlation line graph between the different races over the last 400 years.
•   A Dynamic Bar chart which allows the user to change the year , shows amount of each race executed in that year. 
•   A Scatter Graph Which displays the states with the highest rates of executions.

#Line Graph:
This displays 4 lines of different colours. It displays the amount of a particular race executed over 400 years.  
It allows the user to see any mass increases or compare quantities of each race.

#Dynamic Bar Chart:
This uses controlP5 to implement a user friendly "slider". The user can use the slider to change the current values based on the year on display.
Shows the amount of each race at the bottom of chart. Also displays min and max years on each side respectively.

#ScatterPlot Graph:
Main element of the data set. This displays a nice visualisation of spheres/ balls represented by each state. The size of the sphere depends on the amount
executed in that particular state. The spheres initially start at (0,0) and move slowly across the screen to there final position. Also there is a colour hue
which is calculated based on the y axis. the darker colours are present at the top leaving the brighter ones at the bottom.
Also included a ControP5 buttonBar which allows the user to click and display information about the state and amount executed in the top left corner.

#Other
Included spooky background music and a few haunting images to alter the mood. Did not use a background on graphs as it could impeded data visualisation.
